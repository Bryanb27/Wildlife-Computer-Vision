# Model Performance Overview
This first version of the custom animal species classifier, built using the MobileNetV2 architecture and fine-tuned for multi-class classification, achieves the following metrics:

* Training Accuracy: 75%
* Training Loss: 0.5063
* Validation Accuracy: 57.84%
* Validation Loss: 1.8473

The high training accuracy indicates the model has successfully learned complex features of the dataset, while the disparity between training and validation metrics suggests overfitting.
