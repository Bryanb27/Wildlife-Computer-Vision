# Wildlife-Computer-Vision
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying images of 90 different animal species. Using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture, this model has been fine-tuned for multi-class image classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training was [Animal Image Dataset (90 Different Animals)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals?resource=download) by the author Sourav Banerjee
